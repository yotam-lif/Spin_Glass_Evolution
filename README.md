# Spin Glass Evolutionary Dynamics
This repository contains code to reproduce the results of the publication [1]. 

The code in this repository is also an extensive simulation environment for microbial evolutionary dynamics at microscopic granularity, and may be useful to the grander evolutionary dynamics community for follow-up investigations.

The folder ``py`` contains many useful routines for processing the output simulation data. Some of these are directly used for producing the publication figures, while others are useful for exploratory data analysis.

## Installation
The main simulation package requires ``openmp``, ``boost``, and ``GSL``; all can be installed using standard package managers.

On Mac, ``openmp`` is not supported by the default C++ compiled provided by XCode. The simplest way to proceed is to install ``gcc`` via a package manager such as ``homebrew`` and compile with the corresponding ``gcc`` binary.

The data analysis routines are written in Python and are built upon standard scientific Python libraries (``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``matplotlib``, etc.). ``numba`` is also used to accelerate some computations; it can be installed using ``pip`` or ``conda``.

## Usage
The simulation package can be compiled by running ``make``.

The executable ``lenski_main`` can be use to run a microbial evolution experiment *in-silico*. By default it splits replicate simulations over all available threads. If you want to use less threads, cap the number of threads using the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` environment variable.

The executables ``lenski_vary_epi`` and ``lenski_vary_clonal`` may be used to reproduce the results of the eLife publication, sweeping over the strength of epistasis and the strength of clonal interference.
